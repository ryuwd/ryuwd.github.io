I am a Postgraduate (PhD) researcher at the [University of Edinburgh Particle Physics Experiment](https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/particle-physics-experiment) Group, working on the [LHCb Experiment](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/) based at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider), CERN.

Until September 2020, I was a Postgraduate MSc Research student at the University of Manchester, where I worked on Detector Alignment for the [Mu2e Experiment](https://mu2e.fnal.gov) at [Fermilab](https://fnal.gov). 


A lot of my work involves the analysis of large quantities of data e.g. acquired by the LHCb detector. I am a motivated programmer and regularly contribute to software, where I can. 
My [GitHub](https://github.com/ryuwd) and [CERN GitLab](https://gitlab.cern.ch/roneil) profiles display some of my recent software contributions.
