## About Me

I am a Postgraduate (PhD) researcher at the University of [Edinburgh Particle Physics Experiment (PPE)](https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/particle-physics-experiment) Group, working on the [LHCb Experiment](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/) at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider).

I was a Postgraduate Research student in Experimental Particle Physics at the University of Manchester, working on the [Mu2e Experiment](https://mu2e.fnal.gov) at [Fermilab](https://fnal.gov). 


## Latest projects
- **2019-20** Data-driven Alignment of the Tracker for the Mu2e Experiment with cosmic rays
- **2019-20** Continuous integration tools for the Mu2e Computing and Software group (see [Mu2e/Offline](https://github.com/Mu2e/Offline/pulls))
- **2019-20** Data-acquisition tools for the Mu2e Stopping Target Monitor (test beam)
